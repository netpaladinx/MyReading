1. Causality is much on the objectivity side, whereas reasoning is much on the subjectivity side.
2. Causality is the intrinsic nature of everything changging and evolving, 
whereas reasoning is the way how we capture and interpret this nature to
reflect the objectivity closely as much as possible and go beyond the limitation of our subjectivity. 
3. There are two types of language to execute reasoning - logic language and probability language.
The former provides clear and deterministic reasoning strcture,
whereas the latter well captures uncertainty, being able to handle exceptions.
