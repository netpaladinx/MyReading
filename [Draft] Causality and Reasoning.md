1. Causation is much on the objectivity side, whereas reasoning is much on the subjectivity side.
2. Causation is the intrinsic nature of everything changging and evolving, 
whereas reasoning is the way how we capture and interpret this nature to
reflect the objectivity closely as much as possible and go beyond the limitation of our subjectivity. 
3. There are two types of language to execute reasoning - logic language in term of logic programming,
and probability language in term of probabilistic inference.
The former provides clear and deterministic symbolic reasoning structure,
whereas the latter well captures uncertainty, being able to handle exceptions.
The similarity in their formulation structures is the chain-like rule that helps 
organize every building blocks to make up a complex structured utterance.
4. Causation requires the mimicing reasoning process to go with intervention, rather than passive observation, 
in form of action or attention and see how outcomes are affected by taking or not taking prior intervention.
