1. Causality is much on the objectivity side, whereas reasoning is much on the subjectivity side.
2. Causality is the intrinsic nature of everything changging and evolving, 
whereas reasoning is the way how we capture and interpret this nature to
reflect the objectivity closely as much as possible and go beyond the limitation of our subjectivity. 
3. There are two types of language to execute reasoning - logic language and probability language.
The former provides clear and deterministic reasoning structure,
whereas the latter well captures uncertainty, being able to handle exceptions.
The similarity in their formulation structures is the chain-like rule that helps 
organize every building blocks to make up a complex structured system.
