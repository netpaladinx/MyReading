# Task System for machines V.S. Education System for Humans - AI needs deliberately designed education

Current machine learning and deep learning models are trained by tasks that come mostly from real-life applications with practical purposes. Few tasks are designed specially and systematically for the purpose of pure intelligence. Why is this very important? Much effort today in the AI community has been put on designing AI models that are AI's brains, whereas less studies are concentrated on how to design and organize a series of tasks that help AI grow. 

On the contrary, for human intelligence, we do not put too much thoughts on how our brains are built, whereas we would emphasize the importance of education, create educational environemnt and develop curricula as good as possible to make sure our children's intelligence would grow from a blank canvas into a stunning piece. In this regard, studies on education should be treated as part of the whole ecosystem of AI research. The stories of feral childrens raised by wolves tell us a undeniable fact - the high-level cognitive ability is a production of nurture in education. In other words, education is not only a channel to pass on knowledge from one generation to the next, but also a powerful tool to significantly increase individual cognitive ability.

The term "task system" for machines is derived by analogy to education system for humans. However, we do not refer to the exact meaning and content of human education when mentioning task systems for machines, just as we could not teach a dog the way we teach a human. Instead, machine education should be tailored to suit the need of developing machine intelligence.

A task system should produce a set of tasks, similar in some aspects but different in others. For example, those tasks are set up to solve the same prolem but with different difficulities as in curriculum learning; those tasks face the same prediction goal but with different input domains as in transfer learning. However, lacking a top-level world design, these sort of task setups are not comparable against real-world task setups for humans and even for animals. Therefore, a well-designed task system should be built on a world as the basic and global environment, and all designed tasks should use materials in the world as building blocks.
