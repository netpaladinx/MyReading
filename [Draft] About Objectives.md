# Objective Functions v.s. Life Purposes - How are we motivated to do life-long self-training?

Each time I try to see intelligence in machine learning models, there would be a doubt rising in my brain - 
how could intelligence, with high-level abstract, simply be acquired by a converged gradient descent process?
If you begin to question that, you

the subject we study should be intelligence itself rather than any application-oritented problem
we wish to solve almost everything using intelligence, but first we need to slove intelligence itself

GANs
find a puzzle and solve a puzzle

loop:
from the begining, when we were children, out of curiosity
is it easy to find or construct a puzzle question for the agent
could it be solved by the agent
how much achievement could the agent acquire

chile love cartoon more than movies,
cartoon always have non-authentic scene, 
which color used always pure, 
much difference to the reality, like a talking dog, a jumping lamp,
don't obey physical laws, 
that do not affect children's cognition at all,
on the other hand, children are attracted and motivated. Why?
Cognition might be achieved separately without motivation, and it is the motivation that drive self-training throught our life, implictly or explicitly.

According to the assumptions as made above, we put the ordinary case that children are more likely to obssess themselves into watching cartoon rather than other things into the find-solve framework.

We would find that the authentity of a scene might not be important. The point is that - would it be easy to form a puzzle in children's head, creating a cognitive surprising event and drawing children's attention. Chidren would prefer reading pictures to reading texts, and furtherly, chidren would prefer reading cartoon pictures to reading real-world images.

After forming a puzzle, we will assess whether the puzzle is easy to solve and might try several times to solve it, harder each time. If we solve it, the degree of being able to acquire new knowledge will contribute to the reward. Little acquired knowledge made us feel boring, whereas much knowledge cause us to feel excited. If we cannot solve it after several attempts, we might give up without any reward but being exhaust. Or we would first evaluate whether it is woth solving based on previous experience, including evalute whether we solved it in the past and whether it bring a lot of reward.

For children, it might be easier to find a puzzle in cartoon than in real-world videos, such as a simple dump movement, a strange branna-like head. By wathcing cartoon, a small environment model will be established in children's head, and a narrative story line will be
