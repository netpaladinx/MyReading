    - Guess: The nature of generalization is linearization, and the purpose for performing all kinds of nonlinear transformations is to help the linearity find the underlying space and give a fully play to the talent of the linearity. The nonlinearity is the path but not the destination, since it is the destination for the linearity. When the destination reached, the manifold would fill all the space.
